        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Pamela Flores. I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside studying to get my Bachelor degree in Business Administration. I am currently a full time student as well as a part time worker at a restaurant on campus. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and decided to come to Riverside to study for a change in scenero. I have not yet decided which concentration I plan to go in fully but I think management may be the most probable one. <br><br>

        As a kid I originally thought I would become a doctor specifically a pediatrician. This idea soon changed when I realized how much school I would actually have to go through. Realizing  how hard the process would be I questioned whether or not becoming a doctor was something I actually wanted to be. After eliminating the idea of becoming a doctor, I was lost and confused. I had always thought I was going to become a doctor so trying to figure out something I could possibly become, became a mission.<br><br>

        Growing up I was bullied for being an organized kid. Always wanting to do office work and willing to be in charge of group work was where I always ended up no matter what class I was in. The idea that there was a career that allowed me to do both was crazy to me. I soon found out that a degree in business administration allowed me to do that. So soon business became my new goal. I realized how fitting running a business would be for me. I have always been very independent and liked to take control of projects to make sure they are done properly and neatly. Now when thinking about what possible career path I could go to nothing else seems more fitting then to work in an office. Being in charge of a business or projects for a business is something that I find not only exciting but something I would be willing to do for the rest of my life. <br><br>
        
        My goals for the future are to finish college and get my degree. I would hope to have done internships in college to figure out exactly what kind of company I would like to work with or even for. I would want to go back to school and get my masters as well. I want to either work for a company I am passionate about or create my business. I want to work for a company that holds good morals and if doing something to help other people. Giving back is important to me so ideally a company that holds those same morals would be somewhere I would be excited to work at. <br><br>
